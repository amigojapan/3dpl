            <p>3dpl is an educational real-time interpreted language 
based on Unity3d's JS. It is intended for new programmers to learn 
programming — specifically 3D game programming — while at the same time 
having fun!
            It includes many tutorials, which include: how to make a 
simple cube, how to color the cube, how to make 3D breakout (i.e. 
Arkanoid), how to make a 3D space first-person shooter, and how to make a
 3D first person platforming game, and a Car Simulator and Helicopter Flight Simulator.
            Eventually it will be possible to upload programs to the 
cloud server and download those programs uploaded by other users, but 
this feature is still incomplete and disabled.</p>

            <h3 id="Advice_to_New_Programmers">A word of advice to novice programmers</h3>
            <p>Many of us seasoned programmers started with BASIC and 
LOGO, simple programming languages where you could type a few commands 
and get results. They were fun.
            The debate today between programmers is "what programming 
language should I learn first?" The answer to this question is, of 
course, a matter of opinion.
            Answers range from C++ (a very difficult language) to Python
 (a rather easy language).</p>
            <p>Of course, programming comes easier to some than others. 
Usually I would recommend starting with Python for a regular person of 
high intelligence.
            But I have come across some people that really can't seem to
 grasp the very basics of programming. for such people, I recommend the 
following:
            First learn <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, which is a programming language made by MIT. It is so simple that even kids can enjoy it, and has a (beta) <a href="http://beta.scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/">flash version</a>.
 Then learn my 3D programming language. It has more advanced concepts 
than Scratch and LOGO, such as C style loops, functions, and classes, 
but it is still simple to learn and fun. 
            Then learn <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. it is a general purpose language that will allow you to do many tasks. I recommend <a href="http://www.pygame.org/">the Pygame library</a> once you have finished the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/">Python tutorial</a>, as this will allow you to make fun graphical games in Python. 
            After this, you should be able to learn any other programming language out there.</p>
            <p>If you find that any of these languages seem too easy for
 you, then skip to the next one, but do try starting with Scratch, then 
3dpl, then Python, and then whatever language or languages you want.</p>
            <p>Also it is very important that you study on your own. It 
is never enough to just study what your school tells you to! It is even 
good to study languages other than those your school teaches.</p>

            <h3 id="linux">Linux Support</h3>
            <p>I have received reports from some Linux users that the 
text in the buttons and other controls does not appear. In response to 
the bug reports filed, Unity3D noted that their software only support 
Ubuntu 10.10 at this time. ArchLinux and other Linuxes are not 
officially supported.</p>
            <p>The following list is not very complete, so all 
information on which Linuxes 3dpl works on and which ones it does not 
work on will be appreciated.</p>
            3dpl is known to work on:
            <ul>
                <li>Ubuntu 10.10 (officially supported by Unity3D)</li>
                <li>Linux Mint (unknown version)</li>
            </ul>
            3dpl is known to not work on:
            <ul>
                <li>Mandriva 11.0</li>
                <li>ArchLinux (unknown version)</li>
            </ul>
            3dpl seems to partially work on these Linuxes, with some glitches:
            <ul>
                <li>Debian</li>
            </ul>
