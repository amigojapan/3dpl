<BR>An educational real-time interpreted language. Think of it as "programmable minecraft". It is based on Unity3d's JS for new programmers to learn programming and 3D game programming at the same time, and while having fun!
It includes 18 tutorials (and even more example programs), which include how to make a simple cube how to color the cubes how to make 3D brakeout(arkanoid) and how to make a 3D space first person shooter and how to make a 3D fist person Platform game, and a Car Simulator and Helicopter Flight Simulator.
Also you can upload your programs to the (cloud server, still in development stage) and enjoy a huge library of programs made by other users!(when this feature becomes available).

<BR><span id=Advice_to_novice_programmers><h3>A word of advice to novice programmers</h3></span>
<BR>Many of us seasoned programmers started with BASIC and LOGO, simple programming languages where you could type a few commands and get results. it was fun.
The debate today between programmers is "What programming language should I learn first?", how to answer this question is a matter of opinion.
The answers range from Start with C++(a very difficult language) to python(a rather easy language).
Ofcourse, programming comes easier to some than others. Usually I would recommed starting with python for a regular person who can easily grasp difficult concepts quickly.
But I have come across some people that really can't seem to grasp the very basics of programming. for such people, I recommend the following:
First learn <a href=http://scratch.mit.edu/>scratch</a> , which is a programming language made by MIT(you can now use <a href=http://beta.scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/>scratch in a flash application</a>(it is still in beta testing)), and it is so simple that even kids can enjoy it. 
then learn my 3D programming language. It has more advanced concepts than scratch (like C style loops and functions, and classes) but it is still simple to learn and fun. Then learn <a href=http://www.python.org/>python</a>. it is a general purpose language that will allow you to do many tasks, I recommend <a href=http://www.pygame.org/>the pygame library</a> once you have finished the
<a href=http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/>python tutorial</a>(this will allow you to make fun games in python). After this, you should be able to learn any other programming langauge out there.
<BR>If you find that any of these languages seem too easy for you, then skip to the next one, but try staring from scratch, then 3dpl, then python then whatever language you want.
<BR>Also it is very important that you self study. it is never enough to just study what your school tells you to study!  even other languages that your school does not teach.

<BR> Known bugs: I have gotten reports from some Linux users that the text in the buttons and other controls does not
appear. I have filed a bug report to Unity3d's staff... they replied that they currently only support Ubuntu 10.10. and the person
that gave me a report on the problem is using ArchLinux. I would appreciate it if you could tell me what versions of Linux you have run it on
and if it was successful or unsuccesful. so I can add this to the list for other users.
<BR>Does work on:
<BR>Ubuntu 10.10 (especially supported by unity)
<BR>Linux Mint (unknown version)
<BR>Does not work on:
<BR>Mandriva 11.0
<BR>ArchLinux (unknown version)
