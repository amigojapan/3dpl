<BR>An educational language on Unity3d's JS for new programmers to learn programming and 3D game programming at the same time, and while having fun!
It includes 18 tutorials, which include how to make a simple cube how to color the cubes how to make 3D brakeout(arkanoid) and how to make a 3D space first person shooter and how to make a 3D fist person Platform game.
Also you can upload your programs to the (cloud server, still in development stage) and enjoy a huge library of programs made by other users!(when this feature becomes available)
<BR>
<BR><h3>A word of advice to novice programmers</h3>
<BR>Many of us seasoned programmers started with BASIC and LOGO, simple programming languages where you oculd type a few commands and get results. it was fun.
The debate today between programmers is "What programming language should I learn first?", how to answer this question is a matter of opinion.
The answers range from Start with C++(a very difficult language) to python(a rather easy language).
Ofcourse, programming comes easier to some than others. Usually I would recommed starting with python for a regular person of high intelligence.
But I have come across some people that really can't seem to grasp the very basics of programming. for such people, I recommend the following:
First learn scratch, which is a programming language made by MIT, and it is so simple that even kids can enjoy it. then perhaps learn LOGO (which should be pretty quick)
because scratch does not have functions. and functions are a basic part of programming. then learn my 3D programming language. It has more advanced concepts than scratch and logo
but it still simple to learn and fun. Then learn python. it is a general porpuse language that will allow you to do many tasks, I recommend the pygame library once you have finished the
python tutorial. After this, you should be able to learn any other programming langauge out there.
