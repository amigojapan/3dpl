Source code now released under GPL and LGPL!
to save space, I only included hte script file and the scene file...
you need to make your own Unity3d project and add these files to your project...
then  you should put the Assets folder from inside the Mac binary distribution.

testscript.js   -- this is the main script file (should be put under Assets folder)
scene1.unity    -- this is the main scene file (should be put under Assets folder)
COPYING         -- GPL license file
COPYING.LESSER  -- LGPL lisence file
GUITest.cs      -- this is an unimportant script file (should be put under Assets folder)
